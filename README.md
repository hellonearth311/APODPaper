# APODPaper
A simple app that sets your wallpaper to the NASA APOD (Astronomy Photo Of The Day) every day. Made this since I'm stuck on Windows right now while my Mac is in for repair.

# Setup
Once you run the program for the first time, a window will pop up which asks you for your NASA API key. You have to generate your own. To do so, just google "How to make a NASA API key for APOD" and you can follow the instructions and paste the key.
